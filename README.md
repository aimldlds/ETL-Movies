# ETL-Movies
About For this project I am creating an ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load) pipeline using Python, RegEx, and SQL Database. The goal is to retrieve data from different sources, clean and transform it into a useful format and finally load the data into an SQL database where the data is ready for further analysis.
